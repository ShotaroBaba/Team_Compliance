### About This Thing

This website allows a user to enter the details about their employment to see if they are being paid correctly, as according to the specific Australian Modern Award for their job.

An advantage of this website over others is that you can quickly see how much you should have at least been paid.

This website was created over a day for the Tanda Hackathon 2019 in Brisbane, Australia!
